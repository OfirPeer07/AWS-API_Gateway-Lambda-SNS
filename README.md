### **A little about "Lambda"**
Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, with Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service.  
Lambda runs your function only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.  
Lambda functions allows us to using the Lambda API, or Lambda can run your functions in response to events from other AWS services.

On this page we will create a "Lambda function", first you have to choose a name (for example: Calc2Parameters), then we choose a language in "Runtime" (I chose Python 3.8).  
You can leave all the other options at default and click on "Create function".
